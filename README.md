# Craps

## Introduction
This repository is an example of the game [craps](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps#:~:text=El%20Craps%2C%20tambi%C3%A9n%20llamado%20pase,o%20en%20toda%20una%20ronda.) made in Java 8.

Here I should the process up to build this game. First, it's made on Structural paradigm, and then it's made on Object paradigm.

## Rules
The next rules are taking from various websites. I did a mix with all rules that I like, so maybe rules are not 100 % the originals.

## First stage
**Programación estructural**
